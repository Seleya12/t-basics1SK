# Week 1 Assignment ✌️
This repository contains my first Python assignment for the course.  
The task was to create an ASCII art using only 'print()' statements in Python.

I wanted to make it about something I like so i choose to recrate the logo of my favourite band: Thirty Seconds to Mars. 🎸

## What I Learned 💡

- How to use the 'print()' function in Python.  
- How to create simple ASCII art using code.  
- How to structure a project and upload it to GitHub.

## Logo 🤘

# Week 2 Assignment 🎤 

This repository contains my second Python assignments for the course. 

The task was to create a small interactive text game. 

I decided to make a quiz about something I really like once again, but this time it's about: Linkin Park. 🤘 

The game asks the player five questions about the band, checks the answers, gives feedback, and shows the final score. 

## What I Learned 💡 

- How to use 'if', 'elif', and 'else' to check conditions in Python
- How to use 'input()' to get answers from the user
- How to convert strings to numbers using 'int()'
- How to use 'time.sleep()' to add short pauses and improve the user experience. 


# Week 3 Assignment 🎶

This repository contains my third Python assignment for the course.  
The task was to build a a more complicated ASCII art design by integrating new concepts & tools.

I tried to stay on theme with the previous weeks, where I focused on music-related projects, so I decided to create a fun, interactive music stage , where the instrument name is featured front and center on the stage, with symbols and an audience enjoying the show.


## What I Learned 💡

- How to import and use the random module
- How to build something with nested for loops and string concatenation
- How to use if statements to decide between symbols
- How to repeat a pattern until a condition using a while loop


# Week 4 Assignment 🎧

This repository contains my fourth Python assignment for the course.

This week’s task was all about refactoring, cleaning up and restructuring code without changing what it does. To practice this, I went back to my Week 2 Linkin Park quiz game and gave it a little bit of a makeover.

## What I Learned 💡

- How to define and call my own functions
- The difference between local and global variables
- How to use arguments, return values, and avoid repetition
- What recursion is and how it works
- 

# Week 5 Assignment 📻

This repository contains my fifth Python assignment for the course.

The main focus this week was on understanding Python’s data structures, especially the ones that deal with collections and how they behave when it comes to mutability and references.

To practice this, I wrote a text based studio escape game. 

## What I Learned 💡

- The difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python
- How references work and how changing one variable can affect another if they point to the same object
- How to use dictionaries for storing and retrieving key-value pairs efficiently
- The key traits of sets and tuples, and when to use them
