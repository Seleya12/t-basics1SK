# Week 2 Assignment 🎤

This repository contains my second Python assignments for the course.  
The task was to create a small interactive text game.

I decided to make a quiz about something I really like once again, this time I decide to make it about another favorite Band of mine: **Linkin Park**. 🤘  
The game asks the player five questions about the band, checks the answers, gives feedback, and shows the final score.
