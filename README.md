# Week 2 Assignment 🎤 

This repository contains my second Python assignments for the course. 

The task was to create a small interactive text game. 

I decided to make a quiz about something I really like once again, but this time it's about: Linkin Park. 🤘 

The game asks the player five questions about the band, checks the answers, gives feedback, and shows the final score. 

## What I Learned 💡 

How to use 'if', 'elif', and 'else' to check conditions in Python  
How to use 'input()' to get answers from the user  
How to convert strings to numbers using 'int()'  
How to use 'time.sleep()' to add short pauses and improve the user experience. 


## Week 3 Assignment 🎶

This repository contains my third Python assignment for the course.  
The task was to build a **music-themed ASCII stage**

I chose this topic to stay on theme with the previous weeks, where I focused on music-related topics. Continuing the trend, this week, I decided to create a fun, interactive music stage , where the instrument name is featured front and center on the stage, with symbols and an audience enjoying the show.


## What I Learned 💡

How to import and use the random module
How to build something with nested for loops and string concatenation  
How to use if statements to decide between symbols 
How to repeat a pattern until a condition using a while loop
