# Week 1 Assignment ✌️
This repository contains my first Python assignment for the course.  
The task was to create an ASCII art using only 'print()' statements in Python.

I wanted to make it about something I like so i choose to recrate the logo of my favourite band: Thirty Seconds to Mars. 🎸

## What I Learned 💡

- How to use the 'print()' function in Python.  
- How to create simple ASCII art using code.  
- How to structure a project and upload it to GitHub.

## Logo 🤘
